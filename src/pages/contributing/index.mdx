## Roles and responsibilities

### Consumers

_Consumers_ are members of the community who are applying assets to their development projects. Anyone who wants to apply any of the assets can be a user. We encourage consumers to participate as evangelists and contributors as well.

### Evangelists

_Evangelists_ are members of the community who help others become consumers of the assets. They do so by:
- Advertising the assets and encouraging others to use them
- Supporting new consumers and answering questions, such as on Slack (IBM internal)
- Reporting bugs or missing features through GitHub issues

### Contributors

_Contributors_ are members of the community who help maintain, improve, and expand the assets. In addition to using and evangelizing the assets, they make the assets better by:
- Resolving issues in GitHub to fix bugs, add features, and improve documentation
- Submitting changes as GitHub pull requests

### Maintainers

_Project maintainers_ (aka maintainers) are owners of the project who are committed to the success of the assets in that project. Each project has a team of maintainers, and each team has a lead. In addition to their participation as contributors, maintainers have privileges to:
- Label, close, and manage GitHub issues
- Close and merge GitHub pull requests
- Nominate and vote on new maintainers

## Types of teams

### Core team

Core team members are IBM employees responsible for the leadership and strategic direction of the set of Catalyst projects as a whole. The core team also directs how the Catalyst strategy will evolve with IBM Cloud product decisions. Core team responsibilities include:

- Actively engaging with the projects' communities
- Setting overall direction and vision
- Setting priorities and release schedule
- Focusing on broad, cross-cutting concerns
- Spinning up or shutting down project teams

The core team will operate the technical steering committee.

### Requirements

Set up your SSH Key GitHub account and install node.js 11 or higher.

- [Generating SSH Keys - GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)
- [`nvm` (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to use the
  `Node 6`.


### Make a pull request

**Note:** Before you make a pull request,
[search](https://github.com/ibm-gsi-ecosystem/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/issues) the issues to see if a
similar issue has already been submitted. If a similar issue has been submitted,
assign yourself or ask to be assigned to the issue by posting a comment. If the
issue does not exist, create a new issue.

When you're at a good stopping place and you're ready for feedback from other
contributors and maintainers, **push your commits to your fork**:

#### Commit message format

Each commit message should clearly describe the changes that are being made. During the
development process as many small changes are made, a single one-liner is sufficient for
the commit message.

With larger changes or when the changes in the branch are squashed into a single commit,
the following commit message format is preferred.

_Writing commit messages_

- [Close a commit via commit message](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
- `<type>` indicates the type of commit thatâ€™s being made. This can be: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `docs`, `chore`, `style`, `refactor`.
- `<scope>` the scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change or the thing(s) that changed.
- `<subject>` the subject should be a short overview of the change.
- `<body>` the body should be a detailed description of the change(s). This can be prose or a bulleted listing.
- `<issue reference>` the issue reference should be a reference to the issue number under which this change is being 
made. The issue reference should be in the format of `{git org}/{git repo}#{issue number}`


_Commit message format:_
    
  ```bash
     <BLANK LINE>
     <body>
     <BLANK LINE>
     <issue reference>
  ```
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ```

#### Create a draft pull request when the branch is first pushed to the fork

GitHub recently introduced `draft` pull requests that allow a pull request to be recorded but
marked as not yet ready for review. Git provides a url to open a pull request the first time a branch
is first pushed to the remote, which gives an excellent and easy opportunity to create the draft.

**Note**: Be sure to link the pull request with the issue

Creating a draft pull request early has the following benefits:

1. Clicking the link provided by Git sets up the source and target repos/branches for you so you don't
need to hunt around
2. Having the draft pull request gives insight for everyone else where the work is being done

#### Push changes to your fork frequently during development

As you are making changes, push them frequently to the fork. This ensures that your code is backed up
somewhere and allows everyone else to see what activity is happening. It also means that if you get
pulled into some other work, the latest version of your changes are available for others to possibly
pick up where you left off.

#### Pull in the latest changes from master frequently and rebase your branch

It is good to make sure you are always working off of the latest code from the upstream. With the 
changes in a separate branch, it is easy to bring in upstream changes with the following steps:

1. Checkout master in the local clone

  ```shell script
  git checkout master
  ```

2. Pull in the changes from the `upstream` repository

  ```shell script
  git pull
  ```

3. Check out your branch

  ```shell script
  git checkout {branch}
  ```

4. Rebase your branch on master

  ```shell script
  git rebase master
  ```

5. Force push the changes

  ```shell script
  git push --force-with-lease
  ```

> **Is it a Breaking Change?**

> We want to respect semver. It's important to discern whether your pull request
> contains breaking changes or not. Sometimes, renaming or removing things in
> the code can result in breaking changes.

> Here are some examples of breaking changes... changing, renaming or removing
> any of the following:
>
> - HTML attributes
> - Folders or Files
> - Any SCSS `@mixin`, `$variable` or `function`
> - Any JS `function` or `class`

> We also practice **graceful deprecation** when something is slated to be
> removed -- we mark it as deprecated in the current version and remove it in
> the next major version.

Before you create a pull request, change the base branch depending on what kind
of change you're submitting.

- Pull requests with **non-breaking changes** like patches and minor updates use
  the `master` as the base branch.
- Pull requests with **breaking changes** use the latest `major version number`
  branch as the base branch (i.e. `7.0.0` or whatever the next major version
  is).

Write a title and description then click `Create pull request`

### Updating a pull request

Stay up to date with the activity in your pull request. Maintainers from the
Design System team will be reviewing your work and making comments, asking
questions and suggesting changes to be made before they merge your code.

:tada: You no longer need to squash commits :tada:

When you need to make a change, add, commit and push to your branch normally.

Once all revisions to your pull request are complete, someone from Design
Systems will squash and merge your commits for you.
