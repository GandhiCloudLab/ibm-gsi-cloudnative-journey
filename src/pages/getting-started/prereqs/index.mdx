## Create accounts

<<<<<<< HEAD
You will need to set up the following accounts to use the **Partner Enterprise
 Sandbox environment**

- [GitHub account](http://github.com) (public, not Enterprise): create it if
 you don't have one yet. If you haven't logged in for a while, check that
  you can do so. Make sure to set your enterprise email address as
   the primary address for the account. The **Partner Enterprise Sandbox** administrators will send an invitation to your enterprise email address.

### Configure Github Primary Email address

- Setup your primary email address to match your enterprise one. Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/changing-your-primary-email-address).

### Configure Github Personal Access Token
<<<<<<< HEAD
For your CI pipeline ([Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration), [Tekton](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton)) to connect to and use your GitHub repo, it will need a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with `public_repo` and `write:repo_hook` scopes. The Personal Access Token only needs to be generated once because it is associated with the GitHub account and can be used to access any organizations and repositories that the account can access.


- Navigate to [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a new token. Name it something like "CI pipeline".
- Select the `public_repo` scope to enable Git clone.
- Select the `write:repo_hook` scope so the pipeline can create a webhook
![Pipeline OAuth scopes](pipeline-scopes.png).
- The GitHub UI will not display this token again, so make sure to save
  it in your password manager or somewhere safe that you can access later on.
  
Once you have created these accounts you can validate you can access your
**Partner Enterprise Sandbox** cloud-native development environment.
