## Cloud-Native Learning Journey

<<<<<<< HEAD
The foundation of any modern cloud solution is the **cloud-native** application. This core concept is formulated around an open and flexible platform and programming models that enable a wide range of solutions to be constructed and delivered to users.
   
IBM Cloud and Red Hat aim to help developers and architects realize the value of cloud computing by delivering a world-class open platform that supports enterprise software and **Cloud-Native** applications.

This learning journey has been designed to take developers through a step by step process to build strong skills in both the programming models IBM is aligned towards and the underlying platform, Red Hat OpenShift, a multi/hybrid cloud Kubernetes environment that provides developers extreme flexibility to build solutions.

This Learning Journey targets the following [personas](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_personas/):
- **The Cloud-Native Developer**.
- **The DevSecOps Engineer**.
- **The Op and SRE ([Site Reliability Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering))**.

This Learning Journey focuses on the **Cloud Enterprise Sandbox**, which provides full access to an IBM Cloud **Red Hat OpenShift Cloud Platform** development cluster including a set of CNCF open-source software development lifecycle tools which show the IBM Cloud usage for full DevSecOps development.

The Learning Journey agenda is broken into **Foundation**, **Intermediate** and **Advanced** developer techniques, and then extends with **Application Modernization** and **Application Integration**.

With the **Cloud-Native Journey** you can choose how you want to use the **Cloud Enterprise Sandbox**. You can use the self-paced agenda or work with the Ecosystem Team to have a remote workshop model. The self-paced model will enable longer-term learning with the **Cloud Enterprise Sandbox**.

The foundation of any modern cloud solution is a **Cloud-Native
** application. This core concept is formulated around a flexible platform
 and open programming models. These programming models enable a wide range of
  solutions to be constructed and delivered to users on top of an open
   platform. To enable developers and architects to realise the value of
    Cloud-Native, IBM Cloud and Red Hat have delivered a world class cloud
     open platform to support enterprise software and **Cloud-Native
     ** applications.

This learning journey has been designed to take developers through a step by
 step journey to build strong skills in both the programming models IBM is
  aligned towards and the underlying platform. This platform is Red Hat
   OpenShift, the multi/hybrid cloud kubernetes environment that provides developers extreme flexibility to build solutions for clients.

This Learning Journey is targeted at the following  [personas](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_personas/):
- **The Cloud-Native Developer**
- **The DevSecOps Engineers**
- **The Ops and SRE's ([Site Reliability Engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering))**

The learning journey is focused on using the **Cloud Enterprise Sandbox**. The
 Sandbox provides full access to an IBM Cloud **Red Hat OpenShift Cloud
  Platform** development cluster which includes a set of CNCF open source
   software development lifecycle tools to demonstrate how to use IBM Cloud
    for full DevSecOps development.

The learning journey agenda is broken into **Foundation**, **Intermediate** and **Advanced** developer techniques and then extends with **Application Modernization** and **Application Integration**.

Select the **Cloud-Native Journey** to select the style of how you want to
 use the **Cloud Enterprise Sandbox**. You can use the self paced agenda or
  work with the Cloud Ecosystem team to have a remote workshop model. The self
   paced model will enable longer term learning with the **Cloud Enterprise
    Sandbox**
