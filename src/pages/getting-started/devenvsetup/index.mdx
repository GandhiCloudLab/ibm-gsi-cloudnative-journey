title: Developer Tools Setup
---

To enable the best working experience through the hands-on exercises, you
 need to select the environment you plan to use for development and the required tools for integration with IBM Cloud.

- If you plan to use your desktop/laptop for hands-on exercises, follow
 the instructions in the Desktop/Laptop tab. You will need a recent macOS or
  Windows 10 operating system for this option.
- If you cannot install tools on your desktop/laptop, follow the Cloud Shell
 instructions.
- If you want to try the full web IDE experience, then follow the Code Ready
 Workspaces setup instructions.

Once you have fulfilled these setup requirements you will be ready to
 start the **Developer Intermediate** agenda.

## Introduction to Cloud Shell

IBM Cloud Shell is a free service that gives you complete control of your cloud resources, applications, and infrastructure, from any web browser. It's instantly accessible from your free IBM Cloud account--no other installation is needed.

Features of IBM Cloud Shell include:

- Preconfigured environment: IBM Cloud Shell provides a curated, cloud-based workspace with dozens of preinstalled tools and programming languages. It's automatically authenticated with your IBM Cloud account so you can start to develop immediately.

- File upload/download: use this feature to import files to IBM Cloud Shell or pull-down data to your local machine.

- Multiple sessions: use up to five shell sessions at a time to maximize your productivity. Mirror workflows on your local machine, or view logs on one session while editing a file in another.

### Cloud Shell setup
- Open the IBM Cloud console (cloud.ibm.com) in your browser and log in if needed.

- Invoke Cloud Shell by clicking on the button at the top, right-hand corner of the browser window.

- Install `igc` by running the following commands on the just opened terminal:
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/cloud-shell-commands.git
    $ export PATH=~/cloud-shell-commands:$PATH
    $ source ./cloud-shell-commands/install-igc
    ```

- If sucessful, you should see something like the following:
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/cloud-shell-commands.git

## Tools installation

The following tools are required:

- [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/): needs to be installed in your development operating system, it comes as standard for Mac OS.

- [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started): required for the management of your IBM Cloud Account, and managed IBM Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift clusters
    - Aside from installing the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-install-ibmcloud-cli), you will need to install the [IBM Cloud CLI and Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started#step1-install-idt) too:
    ```bash
    $ curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
    ```
    - Note: if you log in to the web UI using SSO, you'll need to [create an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-federated_id) to log in to the CLI. You can also use this API key for [installing the Developer Tools environment](/admin/installation-ibm-cloud).

- [OpenShift OC CLI](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/oc/): required for Red Hat OpenShift management and development, select 4.3.18 or later version.
    - Place `oc` and `kubectl` in your Terminal `PATH`:

    - #### MacOS/Linux
    - Once downloaded navigate to the `Download` folder:
    ```bash
    $ cd ~/Downloads/openshift-origin-client-tools-v3/
    ```
    - Then copy `oc` and `kubectl` to the system-wide available scripts folder (which is already in your PATH).
    ```bash
    $ cp kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    $ cp oc /usr/local/bin/oc
    ```

    <InlineNotification >

     Depending on your macOS security settings you may need to allow access to `oc` and `kubectl`, go to `System Preferences`=>`Security & Privacy` and press `Allow Anyway`.
     ![security](security.png)

    </InlineNotification>

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop): required for running common tools and [Developer Tools Image](https://ibm-garage-cloud.github.io/ibm-garage-developer-guide/guides/tools-image).
    - Installed and running on your local machine.

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/): required for running the [IBM Garage for Cloud CLI](https://ibm-garage-cloud.github.io/ibm-garage-developer-guide/getting-started/cli).
    - Installed on your local machine.
    - Recommended: `v12.x LTS`.

- [IBM Garage for Cloud CLI](https://ibm-garage-cloud.github.io/ibm-garage-developer-guide/getting-started/cli): used to help make working with the development tools as easy as possible.
    ```bash 
    $ npm i -g @ibmgaragecloud/cloud-native-toolkit-cli
    ```

- [Tekton CLI](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli): used to help control Tekton
 pipelines from the command line.
    ```
    $ brew tap tektoncd/tools
    $ brew install tektoncd/tools/tektoncd-cli
  ```

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download): a popular code editor
    - You will need to edit some files, having a good quality editor is a good practice.
    - Enabling [launching VSCode from a terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line).

- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html) (_optional_): installed on your local machine.
    - Used for SpringBoot content.

## CodeReady Workspace
CodeReady Workspaces (CRW) is a developer workspace server and cloud IDE. Workspaces are defined as the project's code files and all of their required dependencies to edit, build, run, and debug it. Each workspace has its private and full-featured IDE hosted within it. This IDE is accessible through a single-page web application you can run in your web browser.

 Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces provides:
 - Workspaces that include runtimes and browser-based IDEs.
 - RESTful workspace server.
 - Plugins for languages, frameworks, and tools.
 - An SDK for creating plugins and assemblies.

### CRW IDE
CodeReady Workspaces includes a powerful in-browser IDE with support for Microsoft Visual Studio Code extensions. As part of the workshop, we need only a machine capable of running a web browser through which CRW will provide an integrated environment to access the code repository and the build environment required to develop the application, and then test and deploy it on an OpenShift environment.

### Setting up your Workspace on CRW

- Log in to the OpenShift Cluster through the Web console, where the Code Ready Workspace is set up.

- Access the Code Ready Workspace through the URL that has been shared with you.
**Note**: If the code ready workspace is configured through OpenShift oAuth, you can access the above URL once you have logged into the OpenShift Cluster.

- You will need to register the first time you access the Code Ready Workspace. The user name can contain only Latin lowercase characters (a-z), digits, and hyphens in between.
Ensure you provide your user name, email, first name, and last name. If SSO is not configured, you will need to provide the password as well.

- Navigate to the default Code Ready Workspace link  on your browser as shown in the picture below.

  ![CRW](./images/CRW_HomePage.png)

- You can create the workspace by selecting one of the template stacks. Alternatively, you can navigate to the Workspace and click on the "Add Workspace" button.

  ![Adding Workspace](./images/AddWorkspace.png)

- Provide the workspace as part of the Name field. In the Projects section click on the "Remove" button to remove the project template thus creating an empty project.

  ![Creating Project with Empty Template](./images/CreatingNewWorkspace.png)

- Click on the "Create and Open" button to create and load the workspace. This may take a few minutes as the Container and plug-ins related to the stack has to be created and deployed.

- Once the workspace is loaded, you can see the Visual Studio Code editor:

  ![CRWWorkspace](./images/CRWScreen.png)

- Go to the "Terminal" menu and select "Open Terminal in specific container".

  ![Open Terminal](./images/OpeningTerminal.png)

- Select the "Developer Container".

- Install `igc` by running the following commands on the newly opened terminal:
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/cloud-shell-commands.git
    $ export PATH=~/cloud-shell-commands:$PATH
    $ source ./cloud-shell-commands/install-igc
    ```
- Successful installation will look something like this:
    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/cloud-shell-commands.git
    Cloning into 'cloud-shell-commands'...
