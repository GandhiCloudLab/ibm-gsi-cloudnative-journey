title: Developer Tools Setup
---

To enable the best experience for working through the hands on exercises you
 need to select the environment you plan to use for development and the tools
  you require to integration to the IBM Cloud.

- If you are going to use your desktop/laptop for hands on exercises, follow
 the instructions in Desktop/Laptop tab. You will require a modern MacOS or
  Windows 10 operating systems for he Desktop/Laptop option
- If you cannot install tools on your desktop/laptop, follow the Cloud Shell
 instructions
- If you want to try the full web IDE experience, then follow the Code Ready
 Workspaces setup instructions

Once you have completed these setup requirements you will be ready to
 complete the **Developer Intermediate** agenda.

## Config Cloud Shell

IBM Cloud Shell is instantly accessible from your free IBM Cloud account â€” no other installation is needed.

IBM Cloud Shell is a free service from IBM which gives you complete control of your cloud resources, applications and infrastructure, from any web browser.

Features of IBM Cloud Shell include:

- Preconfigured environment
IBM Cloud Shell provides a curated, cloud-based workspace with dozens of preinstalled tools and programming languages. It automatically authenticates to your IBM Cloud account so you can get right to work.

- File upload/download
Utilize file upload/download functionality to import files to IBM Cloud Shell, or pull down data to your local machine.

- Multiple sessions
Use up to five shell sessions at a time to maximize your productivity. Mirror workflows on your local machine, or view logs on one session while editing a file in another

### Set up Cloud Shell
- Login to IBM Cloud console (cloud.ibm.com), if not already done

- Invoke Cloud shell by clicking on the button at the top right hand corner of the browser window
    ![Invoke Cloud Shell](./images/invokecloudshell.png)

- Install `igc` by running the following commands on the just newly opened terminal:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/cloud-shell-commands.git
    export PATH=~/cloud-shell-commands:$PATH
    source ./cloud-shell-commands/install-igc
    ```

## Gitpod

Gitpod provides continuous dev environments for the development flows of common code hosting platforms. 
It is based on theia, the opensource VSCode ide.Its salient features include:
- Parallel sessions: You can open upto 4 parallel workspaces with 4 different git repos at a time.
- Share running workspaces: You can share your live running workspaces with others such that they can see exactly the same processes that you are looking at.
  Share running workspaces feature makes it easy for collaborate and take help to resolve issues. 
- Snapshots: You can take a clone of your complete environament and share it as a workspace with snapshot. It can be used to share some complicated,
  difficult-to-reproduce issues  with teammates or you can save the Snapshot URL your work in the same environment where you left it off.
- Ports: It gives you the option of making the public or private.
- Git integration: As Gitpod has a git integration, pull requests and code reviews can be easily managed from the IDE only.


### Gitpod Access:

Gitpod is available as an extension on Chrome and Firefox:
- Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-dev-environments-i/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki

- Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gitpod/

Other than extension, you can access gitpod by prefixing your github/gitlab/bitbucket repo url with "https://gitpod.io/#"

Both these options will give a gitpod button for accessing the gitpod workspace of that code repository
![Gitpod](./images/gitpod.png)

### Gitpod Setup:

Execute the following steps in the same order on the gitpod terminal:

- Gitpod gives access to only /workspace directory. Create a bin folder inside /workspace directory with appropriate permissions and install
  everything here:
  ```bash
     cd /workspace
     mkdir -m 755 bin
     cd bin
  ```

- Install IBM Cloud

  ```bash
     wget https://clis.cloud.ibm.com/download/bluemix-cli/1.2.2/linux64/archive
     tar -xvf archive
     cd IBM_Cloud_CLI
     cp ibmcloud ../
     cp ibmcloud-analytics ../
  ```   

- Install kubectl,IBM Cloud plugins and oc

   ```bash
      cd /workspace/bin
      curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
   ```
      
  Navigate to the OpenShift Console page.
  Click on QuestionMark(?) icon and select Command Line Tools.

  ![ocinstall](./images/gitpod_ocinstall.png)

  Go to "Download oc for Linux for x86_64" under oc and copy the download link.

    ```
    curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
    ```
    - Note: If you log in to the web UI using SSO, you'll need to [create an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-federated_id) for logging into the CLI. (You can also use this API key for [installing the Developer Tools environment](/admin/installation-ibm-cloud).)

- [OpenShift OC CLI](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/oc/): Required for Red Hat OpenShift management and development, select 4.3.18 or later version.
    - Place `oc` and `kubectl` in your Terminal `PATH`

    - #### MacOS/Linux
    - Once downloaded navigate to Download folder
    ```

<Tab label="Cloud Ready Workspaces">

## Code Ready Workspace
CodeReady Workspaces is a developer workspace server and cloud IDE. Workspaces are defined as project
code files and all of their dependencies necessary to edit, build, run, and debug them. Each workspace
has its own private IDE hosted within it. The IDE is accessible through a browser. The browser downloads
the IDE as a single-page web application.
CodeReady Workspaces will enable a 100% developer experience to
be delivered from a users browser.

 Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces provides:
 - Workspaces that include runtimes and IDEs
 - RESTful workspace server
 - A browser-based IDE
 - Plugins for languages, framework, and tools
 - An SDK for creating plugins and assemblies

### CRW in Workshop
CodeReady Workspaces includes a powerful in-browser IDE with support for Microsoft Visual Studio Code
extensions. As part of the workshop, we need only a machine capable of running a web browser through
which CRW will provide an integrated environment to access the code repo, and the build environment to
develop the code and then  test, and deploy on an OpenShift environment

### Setting up your Workspace on CRW

- Login to the Openshift Cluster through the Web console, where the Code ready workspace is setup.

- Access the Code Ready Workspace through the appropriate Code ready workspace URL that would have been shared.
**Note**:If the code ready workspace is configured through openshiftoAuth, You can access the above URL, once you have logged into the Openshift Cluster

- If you are accessing it for the first time you need register as the registration page will be shown. User name can contain only these characters (0-9, a-z and hypen in between).
Ensure you provide details regarding username, Email, First name and Last name (If SSO is not configured, you need to provide the password as well.

- Navigate to  the default Code Ready Workspace link  on your browser as shown in below picture.

  ![CRW](./images/CRW_HomePage.png)

- You can create the workspace by selecting one of the template stacks as shown in Step 4. Alternatively, navigate to the Workspace and click on the "Add Workspace" button.

  ![Adding Workspace](./images/AddWorkspace.png)

- Provide the workspace as part of the Name field. Click on "Remove" button in the Projects section to remove the project template.
Basically, we are going to create an empty project.

  ![Creating Project with Empty Template](./images/CreatingNewWorkspace.png)

- Click on "Create and Open" button to create and load the workspace. Workspace will start loading. This may take a few minutes as the Container and plug-ins related to the stack has to be created and deployed.

- Once the workspace is  created and loaded, you can see a vscode editor.

  ![CRWWorkspace](./images/CRWScreen.png)

- Go to "Terminal" menu and select "Open Terminal in specific container".

  ![Open Terminal](./images/OpeningTerminal.png)

- Select the "Developer Container".

- Install `igc` by running the following commands on the just newly opened terminal:
