## Overview

Trivy is an open-source tool from Aqua Security to scan container images for vulnerabilities.Â Trivy is a simple and comprehensive vulnerability scanner.

Trivy can detects vulnerabilities of operating systems packages (CentOS, RHEL, Alpine and etc.) and application dependencies (npm, yarn, Composer, etc). Trivy is easy to use. Just install the binary and start the scanning by specifying the target such as an image name of the container.

It is now available as an integrated option within a number of platforms. Trivy is also integrated into the Tekton pipeline of IBM Garage Cloud-Native Toolkit.

With the frequent feature and vulnerability database updates and its comprehensive vulnerability scanning, trivy brings in the higher levels of usability and performance.

Trivy is highly used in Continous-Integration. Before pushing image and other artifacts to a registry or deploying your application, You can scan them easily.

## Features

* Easy install
  * No pre-requisites such as installation of DB, libraries, etc
  * apt-get install, yum install and brew install options are available for quick installation

* Simple
  * Specify only an image name or artifact name.

* Fast
  * The first scan will finish within 10 seconds (depending on your network). Consequent scans will finish in few seconds.

* Detect comprehensive vulnerabilities
  * OS packages (Alpine, Red Hat Universal Base Image, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Oracle Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, openSUSE Leap, SUSE Enterprise Linux, Photon OS and Distroless)
  * Application dependencies (Bundler, Composer, Pipenv, Poetry, npm, yarn and Cargo)

* High accuracy
  * Especially Alpine Linux and RHEL/CentOS
  * Other OSes are also high

* DevSecOps
  * Suitable for CI such as Travis CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, GitLab CI, etc.

## Scanning various artifacts

Trivy can scan the following type of artifacts.

## Image

Trivy can scan container images from the repository.

  ex: trivy image python:3.4-alpine

## Filesystem

Trivy can go through filesystems such as
* host machine
* a virtual machine image 
* unpacked container image filesystem 

By going through the filesystems it can find and scan the following.
  * Image file as tar (ex: trivy image --input ruby-2.3.0.tar)
  * OCI image (ex: trivy image --input /path/to/alpine)
  * Project containing lock files (ex. Gemfile.lock and package-lock.json)

## Embed in Dockerfile

Trivy can scan your image as part of the build process when Trivy is embedded in the Dockerfile. 

## Git Repository

Trivy can scan your remote git repository for OS Packages.

ex: trivy repo https://github.com/knqyf263/trivy-ci-test



## Installation

Trivy installation is very simple. You can use homebrew on macOS to install
```
$ brew install aquasecurity/trivy/trivy
```


## How to scan with Trivy

### Basic Scan

Just by specifying image name you can kickstart the scanning. In the below example `python:3.4-alpine` is scanned.

```
$ trivy image [YOUR_IMAGE_NAME]


$ trivy image python:3.4-alpine
```

Output
```

```

### Filter vulnerabilities by type

Trivy output can be generated as json.

```
$ trivy image --vuln-type os ruby:2.4.0
```

Types can be `os` or `library`

### Trivy Results as JSON

Trivy output can be generated as json.

```
$ trivy image -f json -o results.json python:3.4-alpine
```




## CI with Trivy

As part of the Continoue Integration pipeline you can scan your image using the Trivy. The pipeline can be continued or stoped based on the vulnerabilities detected. To stop the pipeline `--exit-code 1` to be used.

So exit-code is used to break the pipeline based on vulnerability findings.

#### Continue pipeline

In the below example the Pipeline will continue, when MEDIUM and LOW severities found.

```
$ trivy image --exit-code 0 --severity MEDIUM,LOW python:3.4-alpine
```

#### Stop pipeline

In the below example the Pipeline stops, when CRITICAL and HIGH severities found.

```
$ trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity CRITICAL,HIGH python:3.4-alpine
```


## Trivy Scan in IBM Garage Cloud-Native Toolkit

Trivy scan is integrated in IBM Garage Cloud-Native Toolkit. Lets see how the trivy was integrated.

### Tekton Pipeline

Here is the tekton pipeline of the toolkit. Here Trivy scan is done just after the image is created (build) and just before it is deployed in the cluster for health check and so on.

 ![Cloud-Native Toolkit Pipeline ](/images/1-pipeline-tasks.png "Cloud-Native Toolkit Pipeline")

### Pipeline Tasks

Pipeline contains list of tasks. 

 ![Cloud-Native Toolkit Pipeline ](/images/2-pipeline.png "Cloud-Native Toolkit Pipeline")

Line no. 50: Shows build task 
Line no. 70: Shows trivy-scan task
Line no. 80: Shows deploy task

### Build Task

Here is the build task, where the image is build using the dockerfile and pushed to the local container registry.

 ![Cloud-Native Toolkit Pipeline ](/images/3-task-build.png "Cloud-Native Toolkit Pipeline")

Line no. 102: Shows buildah is login into local container registry
Line no. 106: Shows buildah is pushing image to the local container registry

```
+ buildah --storage-driver=overlay push --tls-verify=false --digestfile ./image-digest image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/dev-g2/dev-g-trivy6:605b0ec docker://image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/dev-g2/dev-g-trivy6:605b0ec
```

### trivy-scan Tasks

Trivy-Scan task that shows 2 steps. The steps are Pull-image and Scan-image.

 ![Cloud-Native Toolkit Pipeline ](/images/4-task-scan-1.png "Cloud-Native Toolkit Pipeline")

Line no. 29: Shows pull-image step
Line no. 71: Shows scan-image step


### pull-image step

This is first step of of the trivy-scan task.  This step will copy the image from local container registry to OCI image directory.

 ![Cloud-Native Toolkit Pipeline ](/images/5-task-scan-2.png "Cloud-Native Toolkit Pipeline")

Line no. 70: Using skopeo, the image copy from local container registry to OCI image directory is done.

```
skopeo copy --src-creds=xxxx --src-tls-verify=false docker://image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/dev-g2/dev-g-trivy6:605b0ec oci:/var/oci/image
```

### scan-image step

This is second step of of the trivy-scan task.  This step will kick start the trivy scan using the image stored in the OCI image directory .

 ![Cloud-Native Toolkit Pipeline ](/images/6-task-scan-3.png "Cloud-Native Toolkit Pipeline")

Line no. 80: Trivy scan is done and it print alls the vulnerabilities found in the image.
Line no. 81: Trivy scan is done and it print alls the CRITICAL vulnerabilities found in the image. 
Line no. 84: Checks if any CRITICAL vulnerabilities found
Line no. 86: Exits the pipeline when CRITICAL vulnerabilities found
