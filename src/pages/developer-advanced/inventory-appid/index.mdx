Securing Inventory App with App ID

</PageDescription>

To secure the application we are using the capabilities available within the IBMCloud platform to enable integration with AppId.With Openshift 3.11,
a simple annotation was used on the ingress to enable Appid.In Openshift 4.x,Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud annotations (ingress.bluemix.net/[annotation]) 
and NGINX annotations (nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/[annotation_name]) are not supported for the router or the Ingress resource. With Openshift 4.x,AppId 
integration is enabled with SDKs.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for AppId integration:
- An instance of the App ID service:
  In IBM Cloud Dashboard, go to "Services" and select the AppId instance.

- A set of service credentials:
    - In AppId instance, go to "Application". 
    - Click on "Add application".
    - Enter your application name 
    - Select the type as Regular web application.
    - Click on Save to create the service credentials for your application.

    - After saving, your application credentials will get created.Click on the down Arrow at 
    the left end of your application name and get the credentials.

- NPM version 4 or higher.
- Node version 6 or higher.
- Set your redirect URI in the App ID service dashboard:
    - In the AppID instance, go to Manage Authentication and select the Authentication Settings tab.
    - Under "Add web redirect URLs", type the URL which you want to be redirected.
    - Click on the Circle Plus symbol in the end to add your URL.

## Nodejs SDK 

- Installation: 
    -   By using the command line, change to the directory that contains your Node.js app.
    -   Install the AppID service.
    ```bash
    npm install --save ibmcloud-appid
    ```

- Add the following <i>require</i> definitions to your <i>server.js</i>:
    ```bash
    const express = require('express');
    const session = require('express-session')
    const passport = require('passport');
    const WebAppStrategy = require("ibmcloud-appid").WebAppStrategy;
    const CALLBACK_URL = "/ibm/cloud/appid/callback";
    ```

- Set up your express app to use express-session middleware.
    ```bash
    const app = express();
    app.use(session({
            secret: "123456",
            resave: true,
            saveUninitialized: true
        }));
    app.use(passport.initialize());
    app.use(passport.session());
    ```

-  Obtain your credentials by navigating to the <b>Applications</b> tab of the AppId dashboard as mentioned in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

-  Initialize the SDK using the information obtained in the previous steps.
   ```bash
    passport.use(new WebAppStrategy({
    tenantId: "{tenant-id}",
    clientId: "{client-id}",
    secret: "{secret}",
    oauthServerUrl: "{oauth-server-url}",
    redirectUri: "{app-url}" + CALLBACK_URL
    }));
    ```

-   Configure passport with serialization and deserialization. This configuration step is required for authenticated session persistence across HTTP requests. For more information, see the [passport docs](http://www.passportjs.org/docs/)
    ```bash
    passport.serializeUser(function(user, cb) {
    cb(null, user);
    });
    passport.deserializeUser(function(obj, cb) {
    cb(null, obj);
    });
    ```

-   Add the following code to your <i>server.js</i> to issue the service redirects.
    ```bash
    app.get(CALLBACK_URL, passport.authenticate(WebAppStrategy.STRATEGY_NAME));
    app.use(passport.authenticate(WebAppStrategy.STRATEGY_NAME ));
    ```    

## AppId redirect url config

- Get the ingress for the UI component by running `igc ingress -n dev-{initials}`.

- Open the IBM Cloud resource list - `https://cloud.ibm.com/resources`

- Open the AppId instance to the `Manage Authentication` -> `Authentication Settings` view

    ![AppId authentication settings](images/appid-authentication-settings.png)

- Add the redirect url for the application to the web redirect URLs. The redirect url will have
the following form:

    `{ingress url}/ibm/cloud/appid/callback`
    
    e.g. `https://inventory-manangement-ui-dev.sms-test-oc-cluster.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/ibm/cloud/appid/callback`

## Add users to AppId

- Open the AppId instance to `Cloud Directory` -> `Users`

    ![AppId cloud directory users](images/appid-cloud-directory-users.png)

- Add yourself as a user with an email address, name, and password

## Access the UI

- Open a browser to the UI Application URL

- You should be met with the AppId login screen. (This screen can be customized from the AppId service console but for now we are showing the default screen.)

- Provide the email address and password you configured in the previous steps. You should be granted access to the UI.
